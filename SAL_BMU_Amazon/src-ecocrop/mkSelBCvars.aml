/* Version 2.3
/*
/* This AML creates the 19 BIOCLIM variables from 
/* monthly Tmin, Tmax, and Precipitation grids
/* The results are rounded where integers would become reals
/* (I assume that input values were multiplied by 10
/* and stored as Integers to begin with)
/* P2 is first multiplied by 10
/* CVs are first multiplied by 100.
/*
/* rounding of "x" is done with "int(floor(x + 0.5))"
/* because "int(x+0.5)" as suggested by ESRI (see INT in Arc Help), does not
/* round negative numbers correctly (-2.6 -> -2 intstead of -3)
/*
/* You must change the first four lines (input files and output directory)
/* If you do not have average temperature, create it with the lines that follow
/*
/* Also note that the AML removes some temporary grids if they exist 
/* (the first "&do i = 0 &to 15" bit)
/* Please make sure that you do not have files
/* with those names that you want to keep.
/*
/* BIO1 = Annual Mean Temperature
/* BIO2 = Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (max temp - min temp))
/* BIO3 = Isothermality (P2/P7) (* 100)
/* BIO4 = Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100)
/* BIO5 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month
/* BIO6 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month
/* BIO7 = Temperature Annual Range (P5-P6)
/* BIO8 = Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter 
/* BIO9 = Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter
/* BIO10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter
/* BIO11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter
/* BIO12 = Annual Precipitation
/* BIO13 = Precipitation of Wettest Month
/* BIO14 = Precipitation of Driest Month
/* BIO15 = Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation)
/* BIO16 = Precipitation of Wettest Quarter
/* BIO17 = Precipitation of Driest Quarter
/* BIO18 = Precipitation of Warmest Quarter
/* BIO19 = Precipitation of Coldest Quarter
/* 
/* These summary Bioclimatic variables are after:
/*   Nix, 1986. A biogeographic analysis of Australian elapid snakes. In: R. Longmore (ed.).
/*      Atlas of elapid snakes of Australia. Australian Flora and Fauna Series 7.
/*      Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra.
/*
/* and Expanded following the ANUCLIM manual
/*  
/* 
/* Temperature data is in units of  °C * 10 because that allows me to store the data as Integer values,
/* (with 0.1 °C precision) which is more efficient than storing the data as Real values. 
/* However, you will want to report the data in °C. Precipitation data is in mm.
