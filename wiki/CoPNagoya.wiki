= 10th Conference of Parties (Nagoya, Japan)=

This work was performed in view of the 10th Conference of Parties, to be held in Nagoya (Japan). Most of the scripting was done for the R statistical package (R version 2.11.1), and an additional part was done under ArcInfo Workstation (ESRI).

The purpose of the work was to assess the impact of climate change on Andean plant and bird diversity, using current and future spatially explicit climatic datasets, a database of occurrences, and a niche modeling technique named Maxent. We gathered data from GBIF, CONDESAN and the CDC-UNALM (Peru), filtered such data and performed a thorough modeling for a numerous set of species and then assessed the vulnerability of such species under different future climatic scenarios.
