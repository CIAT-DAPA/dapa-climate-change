= 10th Conference of Parties (Nagoya, Japan)=

This work was performed in view of the 10th Conference of Parties, to be held in Nagoya (Japan). Most of the scripting was done for the R statistical package (R version 2.11.1), and an additional part was done under ArcInfo Workstation (ESRI).

The purpose of the work was to assess the impact of climate change on Andean plant and bird diversity, using current and future spatially explicit climatic datasets, a database of occurrences, and a niche modeling technique named Maxent. We gathered data from GBIF, CONDESAN and the CDC-UNALM (Peru), filtered such data and performed a thorough modeling for a numerous set of species and then assessed the vulnerability of such species under different future climatic scenarios.


= Data structure =

All the modeling inputs and outputs are stored into the network path \\172.22.33.79\COP_CONDESAN. Data contained in folders within this directory is as follows:

  * *background-files:* Contains background files used in the modeling. Naming is done using the structure bg-_speciesID_.csv
  * *backgrounds:* Contains 10,000 background samples for each of the Andean countries. These domains were used for pseudo-absences selection, based on the occurrence rule (if a species has an occurrence within a country then 10,000 pseudo absences from that country are used).
  * *climateData:* Contains all current and future climate data used in the modeling. *andes* contains everything used for projection of maxent models, *andesADM0* contains 30s data used for maxent model training, and *global* contains global data used for uncertainties mapping and original GCM data.
  * *correlations:* Contains the result of the correlation analysis done with the script _`IoBio-correl.R`_
