CMIP3 datasets
---------------------------------------------------------

Priority 1: DeltaStation method for selected timeslices (2020, 2050, 2080) 2.5minute resolution for:
	-SRES-A1B
	-SRES-A2
	-SRES-B1

...Being currently processed in GENOMIX1 & GENOMIX2, using 12 different interpolation zones over the world. Hope that works.

Priority 2: Disaggregation method on 30s data being done by Emmanuel for selected timeslices (2020, 2030, 2040, 2050, 2060, 2070, 2080):
	-SRES-A1B
	-SRES-A2
	-SRES-B1

...Being processed by Emmanuel via Arc/Info and on his local machine
...Script already done

Priority 3: Standard delta method to get 30s data for selected timeslices as for Tyndall (2020, 2030, 2040, 2050, 2060, 2070, 2080):
	-SRES-A1B
	-SRES-A2
	-SRES-B1

...This to be done via Arc/Info on GISSDE
...Write the AML code based on existing code for interpolations but fixing the input file stuff
...Now processing on GISSDE, NINA & PINTA
