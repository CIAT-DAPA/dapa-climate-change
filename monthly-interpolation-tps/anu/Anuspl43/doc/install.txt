Thank you for purchasing ANUSPLIN4.3. 

Program:
     The programs are 32-bit Windows "Console mode" executables, and don't
     create any windows of their own. They are designed to be run from a 
     console prompt, or with input redirected from a command file. 

Documentation:
     The documentation supplied with anusplin is now in the form of a PDF 
     which can be viewed with Acrobat Reader.

Using the example datasets:
     The package is supplied with test results from running the software on
     the development platforms, however it is possible to re-run the tests
     if you are curious. See the Annotated Examples section in the User guide. 

Bug reports:
     Please send bug reports and other feedback to
